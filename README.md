# Hadith-Topics-using-GPT4
<h3> The HadithFinal dataset combines the topics generated by GPT-4 with the LK-Hadith corpus, creating a more unified and valuable resource. It is accessible as an Excel file, with each worksheet dedicated to a specific Hadith collection. Within each sheet, you'll find Hadith entries are organised by their respective unique identifiers and the topics generated by GPT-4. Furthermore, each Hadith topic is accompanied by its English translation, enhancing its accessibility.

 <h3> The Hadith_Teaching_Topics (HTT) dataset comprises the Arabic-Matn of each book in a separate sheet, along with their associated topics in both Arabic and English, accompanied by their unified identifiers IDs.

<h2> It should be noted that the translations of Hadith topics may include some inconsistencies or inaccuracies, as they were generated automatically using the *googletrans==4.0.0-rc1* Python library.
